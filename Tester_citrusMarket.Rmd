## Objective

A summary of my view on whether AcreTrader should invest in US citrus production, including which categories of citrus, with a 10-year time horizon.

- Background Information
  - Citrus Crops
  - Major Growing Regions
  - Citrus Market Size
- Opinions/Outlook
  - Regional Risks (Climate/Pathogens/Agronomic Considerations)
  - Supply Pressures
  - Demand Vulnerability
  - Profitability/Production Budgets
  - International Markets

## Citrus Crops and Growing Regions

## Citrus Crops and Growing Regions

- California makes up approximately 80% of the US fresh market and is maintaining that market share.
  - Some growers shifting to tree nuts due to labor costs
  - Real price of mandarins up 75% since 2000
  - Real price of navels down 5% since 2000

- Florida has experienced 70% drop in growers, processors, and packers from the early 2000s.
  - Largely due to citrus greening and residential expansion
  - Florida growers facing 283% increase in cost of production per box from 2004 to 2016 due to incread total costs and decreased yields 

## Regional Risks - Climate
- Florida
  - Hurricanes
    - Category 2 and higher can result in significant damage
    - Hurricanes Irma (2017) & Ian (2022)
- California
  - Drought
    - Consistent shortages of precipitation in major growing regions
    - Reliance on irrigation/groundwater
    - Higher low temps and fewer freezes has created opportunities for growing in new regions

## Regional Risks - Pathogens/Agronomic Considerations
- Citrus Green Disease or HLB
  - Florida
    - First appeared in 2005
    - Reduced FL citrus production by 75% and doubled cost of production
    - No cure for infected trees with early detection also being difficult
    - Some hybrids are more tolerant but not commercially viable at this point 
  - California
    - First detected in 2012
    - No commercial grove infections
    - Regulatory and preventative measures have increased citrus cost of production
    - Climate in CA is less suitable than in FL and TX
    
Generally, perennial/permanent crops are much slower to benefit from breeding/genetic programs that would enhance traits such as disease resistance or drought tolerance when compared to annual crops. 
    
## Demand Trends
- U.S. per capita orange consumption has declined since 2011
- Strong upward trend in mandarin consumption
- Per capita consumption of mandarins expected to exceed oranges by 2025
- Demand accelerating faster than domestic production
- Chile is the largest supplier of imported mandarins to U.S.

## Supply Trends
- Total U.S. production on a 25 year decline driven by lower yields and acres in Florida
- Domestic orange production exceeds domestic consumption
- U.S. production of mandarins is below domestic consumption
- U.S. production of lemons/limes far below domestic consumption

## Orange Supply

```{r}
orangeYields <- read.csv("OrangeYields.csv")
orangeYields$Value <- gsub(",","", orangeYields$Value)
orangeYields$Value <- as.numeric(orangeYields$Value)

orangeAcres <- read.csv("OrangeAcres.csv")
orangeAcres$Value <- gsub(",","", orangeAcres$Value)
orangeAcres$Value <- as.numeric(orangeAcres$Value)

orangeYieldPlot <- ggplot(data = orangeYields, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = State)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = State), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())+
  ylab(label = "Yield (boxes/acre)")+
  theme_classic()

orangeAcresPlot <- ggplot(data = orangeAcres, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = State)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = State)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())+
  ylab(label = "Acres")+
  theme_classic()


plot(orangeYieldPlot)
plot(orangeAcresPlot)
```

## Tangerine Supply

```{r pressure}
tangerines <- read.csv("tangerineYieldsAcres.csv")
tangYields <- tangerines %>% filter(Data.Item == "TANGERINES - YIELD, MEASURED IN BOXES / ACRE")
tangYields$Value <- gsub(",","", tangYields$Value)
tangYields$Value <- as.numeric(tangYields$Value)
tangAcres <- tangerines %>% filter(Data.Item != "TANGERINES - YIELD, MEASURED IN BOXES / ACRE")
tangAcres$Value <- gsub(",","", tangAcres$Value)
tangAcres$Value <- as.numeric(tangAcres$Value)

tangYieldPlot <- ggplot(data = tangYields, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = State)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = State), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())+
  ylab(label = "Yield (boxes/acre)")+
  theme_classic()

tangAcresPlot <- ggplot(data = tangAcres, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = State)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = State)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())+
  ylab(label = "Acres")+
  theme_classic()

## Florida Production Budgets (University of Florida)

- Positive rates of return for medium to high density new orange orchards under "medium" and "high" price scenarios
- IRR ranging from 6 - 11% under these scenarios and 20-year time horizon 
- Returns based upon cash costs and include appreciation of land value over 20 year period ($3,800/ acre)
- Critical assumptions are no hurricane or freeze impacts and steady yields

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./FA_Orange_prod.png')
```

## California Production Budgets (UC-Davis)

- Positive net cash returns above operating costs for mature groves of oranges, lemons, and mandarins/tangerines
- Positive returns to management for certain lemon regions, oranges, and mandarins.
- Negative returns to management for Ventura lemons are largely due to land prices ($80,000/acre)
 
- Oranges 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./CA_Orange_prod.png')
```

## Mandarin and Lemon Budgets
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./CA_Mandarine_prod.png')
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./CA_Lemon_prod.png')
```

## International Markets
- U.S. is largely an importer of citrus other than oranges
- Robust domestic demand for mandarins, lemons, and limes with imports coming from Mexico, Chile, and Argentina
- Brazil, South Africa, and China are major orange producing countries

## Summary
- The U.S. Citrus industry as a whole is facing major headwinds on the supply side
  - Citrus Greening
  - Residential Expansion
  - Drought
- However, profitable opportunities exist especially in California for mandarins and lemons 
  - San Joaquin Valley
  - Positive returns to management for both crops
  - Largest risks are drought and continued expansion of tree nut production
